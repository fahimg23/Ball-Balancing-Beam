# Ball Balancing Beam

PID control system that uses ultrasonic sensors and a servo to move a ball to the center of the beam (set point can be changed, but the gain constants are not ideal so will have to be tuned). 

Equipment: </br>

1. Microcontroller Board: Arduino Uno R3 (ATMega 328/P MCU)
2. 2 Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) </br>
3. Power HD 1501MG servo </br>
4. Ultrasonic sensor mounts  (.stl files included in the master branch)</br>
5. A rail/beam to hold a ball. For this project, a metal 1m long 1 inch wide rail was used</br>
6. A ball that sits on top on the rail or inside it. For this project, a pool ball was used </br>
